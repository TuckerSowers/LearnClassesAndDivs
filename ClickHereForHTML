Copy the code below and paste into your own text editor

HTML (index.html)

<!DOCTYPE html>

  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <script src="script.js"></script>

  <body>
     
    <h1>My Fake NewsPaper</h1>
    
    <!--There is a definite problem below.  Each h1 header is the same.  What's a boy or girl to do? (Hint, we are going to use classes!)-->
    
    <h1>Article #1:  JP and Sabrina receive counselor of the year award!</h1>
    <p>JP and Sabrina rock.  Full stop.  I don't know how we could have ever done it without them.  Creative Summer would not be the same.</p>
    
    <h1>Article #2: Tucker eats pizza at camp and loves it</h1>
    <p> Yum factor = one million.  It is actually the greatest thing since bread and cheese became one!  Give me more!  Now.  Right Meow!  </p>
    
    <!--Challenge Number 2 - We want our two articles to be side by side.  Help!  (Hint - we are going to use divs, width, and floats -->
    <!--Challenge Number 3 - What if we want the article on the left to be 40% of the width of viewport? Hmmm....-->
